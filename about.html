        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Sean Fitzgerald and I was born and raised in Clinton, CT. I am a sophomore at URI studying business marketing, and I am also hoping to look into a minor in computer science. I love being outdoors and playing almost any sports, and finding new hobbies is something I really enjoy. I have a dog named Maddie and two sisters who are both in their mid twenties. I have been interested in coding since high school but the classes they offered were not very good. The winter is becoming my favorite season because of skiing. I have skiied my entire life and I got the opportunity to go out West and have the time of my life. The picture of me is in front of the Grand Canyon, as traveling is one of my hobbies and this is the most insane historical place that I have ever been to. I highly recommend taking the trip out! I am excited to create this webpage and you can contact me through email: sean_fitz8181@uri.edu. </p>
