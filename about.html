        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Sean Fitzgerald and I was born and raised in Clinton, CT. I am a sophomore at URI studying business marketing, and I am also hoping to look into a minor in computer science. I love being outdoors and playing almost any sports, and finding new hobbies is something I really enjoy. I have a dog named Maddie and two sisters who are both in their mid twenties. I have been interested in coding since high school but the classes they offered were not very good. I am excited to create this webpage and you can contact me through email: sean_fitz8181@uri.edu. </p>
