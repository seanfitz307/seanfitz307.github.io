  <h1> "Head Soccer with Sean and Miles!" </h1>
  <p> The goal of this game is to score more goals than your opponent in the ninety second match. In order to kick the ball, you need to move and jump with the two characters in the game. The character on the left is Sean and the opponent is Miles. If you are controlling Sean, use W to jump, A to move left, and D to move right. If you are playing as Miles, use the up, left, and right arrows to control him. You can hit the ball with any part of the character, and you can jump pretty high! Also, throughout the game there are random powerups that spawn in. For example, if there is a lightning bolt and you grab it with your character by jumping into it, you gain a speed boost for a certain amount of time. Other than that play to have fun, and hopefully the fans will be on your side! </p>
